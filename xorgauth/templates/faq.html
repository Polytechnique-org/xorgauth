<h3>{% trans "My email address is not recognized. What is my login?" %}</h3>
<p>{% blocktrans %}If you studied at the École polytechnique, your Polytechnique.org identifier is <tt>firstname.lastname.promotion</tt>. For example if Albert Bonnaventure is a polytechnicien who entered the school in 1842, his login will be <tt>albert.bonnaventure.1842</tt>. If Catherine Du Chateau defended the PhD that she prepared at the École polytechnique in 2345, her login will be <tt>catherine.du-chateau.d2345</tt>. If nobody else shared her name in Polytechnique.org's directory, she can also use <tt>catherine.du-chateau</tt> to log in.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
<p>{% blocktrans %}The email addresses provided by Polytechnique.org can also be used, like <tt>albert.bonnaventure.1842@polytechnique.org</tt> and <tt>catherine.dupont.d2345@alumni.polytechnique.org</tt>.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
<p>{% blocktrans with contact_mail_link='<a href="mailto:contact@polytechnique.org">contact@polytechnique.org</a>' %}If you did not study at the École polytechnique, you may still have an account, for example if you are participating in activities of a <i>Groupe X</i> or if you are a school staff. Such an account is identified by an email address. Please contact us at {{ contact_mail_link }} if you encounter difficulties using your account.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans "I have forgotten my password. How do I reset it?" %}</h3>
<p>{% blocktrans %}You need to enter your login in the <a href="{{ pwd_reset_url }}">password recovery page</a> and check the mailbox associated with your Polytechnique.org email address.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans "I have forgotten my password and I changed my email address so I no longer receive the Polytechnique.org emails. Could you help me?" %}</h3>
<p>{% blocktrans with contact_mail_link='<a href="mailto:contact@polytechnique.org">contact@polytechnique.org</a>' %}Yes, of course. Please send your request and some details which will allow Polytechnique.org team to check your identity (scan of your ID card, mobile phone number which has been defined in the directory, email address which has been associated with your Polytechnique.org account, institutional email address at a reputable institution, etc.) to {{ contact_mail_link }}. Please be aware that answering to all the messages we receive takes much time, so we may reply several weeks later. This is why it is so important to keep your Polytechnique.org email address working.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans "I studied at the École polytechnique and I do not have an account. Where do I register?" %}</h3>
<p>{% blocktrans with xorg_link='<a href="https://www.polytechnique.org">https://www.polytechnique.org</a>' xorg_reg_link='<a href="https://www.polytechnique.org/register">https://www.polytechnique.org/register</a>' %}You need to create an account on {{ xorg_link }} in order to create a Polytechnique.org email address. The registration page is {{ xorg_reg_link }}. Please note that only alumni of the École polytechnique can register on {{ xorg_link }}.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
<p>{% blocktrans with xorg_search_link='<a href="https://www.polytechnique.org/search">https://www.polytechnique.org/search</a>' %}If the registration page does not recognize your name, search your profile in Polytechnique.org's directory, {{ xorg_search_link }}. If your profile exists, please check the special characters (é, è, ç, etc.) and your school ID if you have one. It may also mean that your account has already been activated (in which case, please take a look at the previous questions in order to recover your password).{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans with school_pegase_link='<a href="https://portail.polytechnique.edu/dsi/eleves/portail-de-services">https://portail.polytechnique.edu/dsi/eleves/portail-de-services</a>' %}If your profile does not exist in Polytechnique.org's directory, you need to make the École polytechnique transmit your personal information to Polytechnique.org. If you are still studying, please go to {{ school_pegase_link }}, read its content, connect to Pegase and tick the checkboxes for Polytechnique.org and AX.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

This is why you have to wait a little bit before being able to log in.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

This would redirect you to {{ auth_xorg_link }}. If you encounter an error, be sure to write down the address of the website where the error occurs ({{ ax_link }} or {{ auth_xorg_link }}) before reporting a problem.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans with auth_xorg_link='<a href="https://auth.polytechnique.org">https://auth.polytechnique.org</a>' %}Both these websites automatically redirect to {{ auth_xorg_link }} when accessing a page which requires authentication. They also provide login buttons to authenticate on every page.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
